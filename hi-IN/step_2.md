A "prompt" for large language models (LLMs) is the text you give to the model to get a response. It's like asking a question or giving a starting point for the model to create text. For example, if you type "Tell me a joke" — that's your prompt — so the model should respond with a joke.

Getting good at writing solid prompts will make you awesome at using AI tools.

### Objective

Decide what you want to achieve. This is your goal when using the language model. Write this in your prompt, clearly stating **what you want to have** when you are finished with the LLM.

\--- task ---

Start your prompt with an **Objective**, which should begin: I want help creating **something**.

उदाहरण के लिए:

"I want help creating a **recipe for a simple dessert**."
"I want help creating a **short story**."
"I want help creating a **study plan for my History exams**."

\--- /task ---

### Context

Give background details to help the model process your request. Include important information like length, who the audience is, tone, and specific facts you want to include.

\--- task ---

Give **Context** to your prompt.

उदाहरण के लिए:

"I want help creating a recipe for a simple dessert. **Make the recipe easy to follow for kids, with ingredients that can be found at home.**"

\--- /task ---

### उदाहरण

Show what kind of answers you’re looking for by providing **examples**. This helps the model get it right. You can give examples of other recipes you like, things you definitely want included, or ways of writing the recipe you have enjoyed.

\--- task ---

Add **Examples** to your prompt.

उदाहरण के लिए:

"I want help creating a recipe for a simple dessert. Make the recipe easy to follow for kids, with ingredients that can be found at home. **I like recipes that include creative choices, like decorating with sprinkles or adding icing. Write the recipe with a clear list of ingredients, with the method in numbered steps.**"

\--- /task ---

### Assess

Even though it might seem like it, LLMs don’t understand anything like humans do. Instead, LLMs just choose the **next best word** by predicting patterns in language. They're really just like fancy auto-complete. Sometimes they output things that are wrong or unfair, and **you** have to be careful they don't get you in trouble because you didn't check the output properly.

\--- task ---

Check if the response fits what you wanted. Look for mistakes or things that don't make sense.

उदाहरण के लिए:

- Does the recipe list all the ingredients and steps clearly?
- Is there a fun decoration step?
- Are there any crazy ingredients or methods that might be dangerous?
- Are there any parts of the text that are wrong about a fact?
- Are there things you don't understand?

\--- /task ---

### Negotiate

If the response isn’t quite right, ask the LLM to make changes. Be specific about what needs to be fixed. Treat the LLM like a project partner who isn't very good — check the work twice to make sure it's ok, then make sure the LLM corrects any errors or things you don't like.

\--- task ---

Suggest changes and corrections to the LLM.

उदाहरण के लिए:

"Close, but not quite. You didn't number the method steps, and I don't have any dark chocolate in the cupboard. I am also not allowed to use a blowtorch."

\--- /task ---

**Most important step: The human edit**

\--- task ---

Check the response one last time to make sure it’s easy to follow, correct, and complete. There will be a time when it is simply easier to change the words and small things you don't like than keep asking the LLM to do it for you.

**It's totally on you (the person) to make sure the tool you are using is working correctly and that the output from it isn't used to cause harm.**

\--- /task ---

In the next step, you will look at setting a **persona** for an LLM.
