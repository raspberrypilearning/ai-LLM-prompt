Um "prompt" para grandes modelos de linguagem (LLMs) é o texto que você fornece ao modelo para obter uma resposta. É como fazer uma pergunta ou dar um ponto de partida para o modelo criar o texto. Por exemplo, se você digitar "Me conte uma piada" — esse é o seu prompt — então o modelo deve responder com uma piada.

Aprender a escrever prompts sólidos o tornará excelente no uso de ferramentas de IA.

### Objetivo

Decida o que você quer alcançar. Este é seu objetivo ao usar o modelo de linguagem. Escreva isso em seu prompt, declarando com clareza **o que você quer ter** quando terminar de interagir com o LLM.

\--- task ---

Comece seu prompt com um **Objetivo**, que deve começar com: Quero ajuda para criar **algo**.

Por exemplo:

"Quero ajuda para criar uma **receita para uma sobremesa simples**."
"Quero ajuda para criar um **conto**."
"Quero ajuda para criar um **plano de estudos para minhas provas de História**."

\--- /task ---

### Contexto

Give background details to help the model process your request. Include important information like length, who the audience is, tone, and specific facts you want to include.

\--- task ---

Give **Context** to your prompt.

Por exemplo:

"I want help creating a recipe for a simple dessert. **Make the recipe easy to follow for kids, with ingredients that can be found at home.**"

\--- /task ---

### Exemplos

Show what kind of answers you’re looking for by providing **examples**. This helps the model get it right. You can give examples of other recipes you like, things you definitely want included, or ways of writing the recipe you have enjoyed.

\--- task ---

Add **Examples** to your prompt.

Por exemplo:

"I want help creating a recipe for a simple dessert. Make the recipe easy to follow for kids, with ingredients that can be found at home. **I like recipes that include creative choices, like decorating with sprinkles or adding icing. Write the recipe with a clear list of ingredients, with the method in numbered steps.**"

\--- /task ---

### Assess

Even though it might seem like it, LLMs don’t understand anything like humans do. Instead, LLMs just choose the **next best word** by predicting patterns in language. They're really just like fancy auto-complete. Sometimes they output things that are wrong or unfair, and **you** have to be careful they don't get you in trouble because you didn't check the output properly.

\--- task ---

Check if the response fits what you wanted. Look for mistakes or things that don't make sense.

Por exemplo:

- Does the recipe list all the ingredients and steps clearly?
- Is there a fun decoration step?
- Are there any crazy ingredients or methods that might be dangerous?
- Are there any parts of the text that are wrong about a fact?
- Are there things you don't understand?

\--- /task ---

### Negotiate

If the response isn’t quite right, ask the LLM to make changes. Be specific about what needs to be fixed. Treat the LLM like a project partner who isn't very good — check the work twice to make sure it's ok, then make sure the LLM corrects any errors or things you don't like.

\--- task ---

Suggest changes and corrections to the LLM.

Por exemplo:

"Close, but not quite. You didn't number the method steps, and I don't have any dark chocolate in the cupboard. I am also not allowed to use a blowtorch."

\--- /task ---

**Most important step: The human edit**

\--- task ---

Check the response one last time to make sure it’s easy to follow, correct, and complete. There will be a time when it is simply easier to change the words and small things you don't like than keep asking the LLM to do it for you.

**It's totally on you (the person) to make sure the tool you are using is working correctly and that the output from it isn't used to cause harm.**

\--- /task ---

In the next step, you will look at setting a **persona** for an LLM.
