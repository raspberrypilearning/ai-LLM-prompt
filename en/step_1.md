This guide will help you start with simple ideas and turn them into detailed prompts that produce reliable text from LLMs. Following the OCEAN process, you'll work through bulding a prompt with a clear **O**bjective, **C**ontext and **E**xamples, then **A**ssess the output of the LLM and **N**egotiate until the output is what you envisioned.
