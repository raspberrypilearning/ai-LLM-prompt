This guide will help you start with a simple idea and turn it into a detailed prompt that will produce reliable text from a LLM. By following the OCEAN process, you'll learn how to build a prompt with a clear **O**bjective, **C**ontext, and **E**xamples, then **A**ssess the output of the LLM and **N**egotiate until the output matches your original idea.

### You will need:
Before you begin, you'll need access to an LLM. 

If you are under the required age limits or prefer to host **your own** large language model on a Raspberry Pi, [follow our instructions here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/llm-rpi){:target="_blank"}.

Other online tools are available, but require registration with a current email address. Some examples include:
