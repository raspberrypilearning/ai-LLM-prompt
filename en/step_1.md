## What you will make

Welcome to the exciting world of large language models! 

By following these steps, you will learn how to prompt a large language model (LLM) in a clear way, to get the best results from these powerful AI tools.

This guide will help you start with a simple idea and turn it into a detailed prompt that will produce reliable text from a LLM. By following the OCEAN process, you'll learn how to build a prompt with a clear **O**bjective, **C**ontext, and **E**xamples, then **A**ssess the output of the LLM and **N**egotiate until the output matches your original idea.

### You will need:
Before you begin, you'll need access to an LLM. 

If you are under the required age limits or prefer to host **your own** large language model on a Raspberry Pi, [follow our instructions here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/llm-rpi){:target="_blank"}.

Other online tools are available, but require registration with a current email address. Some examples include:

If you're under 13 years old, it's important to understand how to keep your personal information safe. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is very careful about protecting your data and your privacy.

When you use generative AI projects on a Raspberry Pi, all of the work happens right on your device. **Your personal data stays on your computer and never leaves it.** This keeps your information safe and secure.

You might have noticed that many online services ask users to be at least 13 years old. This is because they handle and store data you provide, which can include personal information. Although these services follow strict rules to protect your data, sending information over the internet can sometimes be less secure.

**With the Raspberry Pi, everything stays on your own device,** so you don’t have to worry about your data being sent elsewhere. This lets you explore and learn about AI safely. If you need help, please ask a parent, guardian, or teacher to guide you.

It's also important to know that generative AI can sometimes create **content that isn’t accurate, fair, or appropriate**. These AI models can sometimes "hallucinate" and **produce information that sounds true but isn’t.** So, it’s important to **think carefully about the AI’s output and double-check it**. As you work with generative AI, make sure to check the information and ask trusted sources if you’re unsure.

**Always look at AI-generated content with a careful and thoughtful mind.**

Enjoy learning and creating with Generative AI!
