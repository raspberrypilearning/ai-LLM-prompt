## What you will make

Welcome to the exciting world of Large Language Models! 

By following these steps, you will learn how to prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) in a clear way, to get the best results from these powerful AI tools. 

This guide will help you start with simple ideas and turn them into detailed prompts that produce reliable text from LLMs. Following the OCEAN process, you'll work through bulding a prompt with a clear **O**bjective, **C**ontext and **E**xamples, then **A**ssess the output of the LLM and **N**egotiate until the output is what you envisioned.

### You will need:
Before you begin, you'll need access to an LLM. 

If you are under the required age limits or prefer to host *your own* Large Language Model on a Raspberry Pi, [follow our instructions here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/llm-rpi){:target="_blank"}.

Other online tools are available, but require registration with a current email address. Some examples include:
