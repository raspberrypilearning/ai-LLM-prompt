## The OCEAN Prompting Process: Personas

Personas are like different roles or characters you can ask the language model to play. This shapes how it talks and interacts with you. For example, you might want the model to act like a friendly teacher, helpful friend, fictional character or a historical figure and have a discussion with you, or help you explore some of your own ideas.


### Objective
Decide what role you want the language model to take on. Write this in your prompt, clearly stating the role you want it to play.

Start your prompt with an **Objective**, which should begin: Behave as *someone*. 

For example:

"Behave as a supportive and encouraging coach."

### Context
Give background details to help the model understand the role. Include specific information about how you want it to behave.

Give **Context** to your prompt.

For example:

"Behave as a supportive and encouraging coach *who helps with studying for exams*."
