00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,200
Let's make great prompts with the OCEAN process!

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,800
O is for Objective. Set a clear goal!
Whether you're explaining a topic or  

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,160
writing a story, defining what you want helps 
the model deliver exactly what you need. 

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,480
For example, start with, 'I 
want to explain what climate  

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,080
change is.' This sets a basic 
goal for the model to follow.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,200
C is for Context. Give the model all the 
background info: audience, style, key details. 

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,120
You could expand the prompt to 'Explain what 
climate change is, to middle school students,  

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,120
in a friendly and simple way.' Which 
helps set the appropriate style and tone.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,080
E is for examples. Give the model examples 
you like to guide the model's output. 

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,160
For instance, you might provide links or describe 
other educational videos that explain science  

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,160
topics simply and engagingly, helping the 
model understand the desired output style.

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,480
A is for Assess. Assess the output from the model. 

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,080
Does it match your goal? Check for clarity, 
relevance and any unfairness. For example,  

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,640
ask 'Is this easy to understand?' and 'Does it 
cover what I needed?' to ensure it's on point.

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,120
N is for Negotiate. If it's 
not perfect - negotiate. 

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,560
Improve the output by giving the model clear,  

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,240
honest feedback to make the 
output closer to what you want. 

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,920
Once it's pretty close, the rest 
is up to you... the human editor.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,280
Finally, go through and edit the work yourself. 
The model has done the heavy lifting,  

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,920
but your final and unique touch 
ensures quality and accuracy.

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,480
Any work you say is yours, 
should actually be your work!
