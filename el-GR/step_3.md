## The OCEAN prompting process: Personas

Personas are like different roles or characters you can ask the language model to take on. This shapes how it interacts with you. For example, you might want the model to appear to be a friendly teacher, helpful friend, fictional character, or a historical figure and have a discussion with you, or help you explore some of your own ideas. Using a persona allows _every_ interaction with the LLM to be in a specific context which you set, not just the text it outputs.

### Objective

Decide what role you want the language model to take on. Write this in your prompt, clearly stating the role you want it to play.

<span style="color: red;">In the examples below, objective text is in red.</span>

### Συμφραζόμενα

Give background details to help the model understand the role. Include specific information about how you want it to behave.

<span style="color: blue;">In the examples below, context text is in blue.</span>

### Παραδείγματα

Show what kind of answers you’re looking for by providing **examples**. This helps the model get it right. You can give examples of things you definitely want included, or ways of speaking you have enjoyed.

Suggest changes and corrections to the LLM.
